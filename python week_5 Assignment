# Complete file handling script

# Task 1: File Creation - Create a new text file and write lines of text
try:

        file.write("Finally, the third line is just text.\n")

    # Task 2: File Reading and Display - Reading the file content and displaying it
    with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print("File contents after writing:")

    # Task 3: File Appending - Append three more lines to the file
    with open('my_file.txt', 'a') as file:
        file.write("This is the fourth line, added later.\n")
        file.write("The fifth line also contains a number: 123\n")
        file.write("And the sixth line concludes this file.\n")
